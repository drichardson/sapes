1. What can you access in a multithreaded application? errno?
2. Should mailboxes be case sensitive or not? I hope not, because they
are implemented as directory names. On Windows, that is only
case insensitive.
4. Must accept messages to postmaster
5. When you bounce a message, you sent a message from postmaster@domain. If you
have more than one domain, which one do you choose? Does it matter?
6. Keep track of the MTA who sent the message so that you can report it in the
bounced message.

1 Make sure all functions you use are reentrant.
2 Make sure you strip off the final .<CRLF> when you put the file in a local mailbox.
3 You must accept messages addressed to postmaster

Relay messages - when a client connects and sends a message relay it to the correct destination. If
the mail isn't accepted at the destination then send an e-mail back to the client saying that the
message was rejected.

	Logic - if domain is not a domain that I am responsible for then relay the message to the
	server responsible for that domain (as given by the MX record from the DNS server).

Accept messages - when a client connects and sends a message to the domain that this server is responsible
for then verify the mailbox exists and store the message in the appropriate mailbox.

	Logic - if domain is the domain I am responsible for then store the message in the appropriate
	user's mailbox.

Mailboxes - Each account has a folder that contains all of the messages for that account. Each message
is stored in a single file. The name of the file is a generated unique name that implies nothing about
the content of the message, when it was received, the order it was received, or anything else.

Handling multiple domains - Each domain that the server is responsible for has a folder that contains all mailboxes. For instance, if the server is responsible for the-richardsons.org and for lbcf.org, then two folders will exist.
Suppose the user doug and rebecca exist on the-richardsons.org and kim exists on lbcf.org. Then the directory
structure will look like this:

	path to the-richardsons.org folder
		doug
		rebecca
	path to lbcf.org folder
		kim



Directory Structure
	mailserv root
		mailserv
		global options files

	path to domain1 folder
		mailbox1
		...
		mailboxN
	...
	path to domainN folder
		mailbox1
		...
		mailboxN


Global Options

smtp_port - the port to listen on (default 25).
Domain - a domain that the server is responsible for. Multiple entries mean the server is responsible for multiple domains.
SendDir - the directory where mail messages are stored before they are moved to mailboxes or sent to other SMTP servers. There is no default for this option. No other applications should write files to this directory.
ScanInterval - how often in seconds to check the SendDir for files to send. Default is 5 seconds.
SenderThreads - the number of sender threads the server should create. Default is 5.

example options file
smtp_port:25
pop3_port:110
scan_interval:5
sender_threads:5
domain_count:2
domain1:the-richardsons.org
domain1_mailbox:c:\mailboxes\the-richardsons.org
domain2:lbcf.org
domain2_mailbox:c:\lbcfmail



Send file format - each line ends with CRLF. No line can exceed the text line limit specified in RFC 2821,
which is 1000 characters (including the CRLF).

Notes - Make sure that when the server is shutdown no sendDir files are partially processed.

POP3 Part
***************************************************************
client does this:
1 connects
2 sends user
3 sends pass (optional)
4 sends stat, list, retr, dele, noop, rset, or quit

The argument to the user command should be mailbox@domain since
mailserv can operate mail for more than one domain.
